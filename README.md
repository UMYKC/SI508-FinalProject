# Project Objective
I have been watching NBA for 7 years. I always check out the game result on a Taiwan website, called **PTT Bulletin Board System**, instead of NBA.com at the end of every day and the way it performs those game is like
[12/9 2018 Jazz Spurs]https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/NBA/M.1544408033.A.95D.html

[12/9 2018 Bucks Raptors]https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/NBA/M.1544405017.A.E79.html

![EXAMPLE](https://github.com/UMYKC/SI508-FinalProject/blob/master/Image/NBA_HORNETS_SPURS_PTT.png)

When I saw it for the first time, I thought the style was very cool. Hence, for my final project, I want to make a similar but simple one and display those results via terminal

![PLAYER INFO TABLE](https://github.com/UMYKC/SI508-FinalProject/blob/master/Image/PLAYER_INFO_TABLE.png)
